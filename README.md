This is a simple pathfinding algorithm visualizer made with React and TypeScript. It currently supports :
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search

- Recursive Backtracking Weighted Maze Generation


this project inspired by a tutorial from Clement Mihailescu on youtube. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak).
it been since 4 years ago, and I just want to make it again with my own style and add some features. also change from vanilla javascript to typescript and from react class to react hooks.

I have learned a lot from this project, and I hope you can learn something from this project too.
